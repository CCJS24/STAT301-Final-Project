    "\n",
    "**Why this method is appropriate**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- effective for binary classification, and finding the true relation between the continuous numeric input variables and the binary heart disease variable _target_\n",
    "- binary logistic regression is an effective regression model for probability of each value in dichotomous dependent variables, such as the dummy response variable _target_ ( equals 1 or 0) in the heart disease dataset. This is improved by selection and regularization via LASSO\n",
    "- LASSO shrinkage helps to reduce overfitting\n",
    "- LASSO feature selection picks input variables with minimal multicollinearity to include only significant variables in a model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Assumptions to apply Binary Logistic Regression**:\n",
    "- The target variable is binary with two possible outcomes (in this dataset: 0 = no heart disease and 1=has heart disease)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Independent observations: no correlated data points exist, each observation was independently collected, and had no influence on each other\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Moderate or very low multicollinearity: explanatory variables should be weakly or not at all correlated to prevent issues with lower precision, such as estimated coefficients with large confidence intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential limitations or weaknesses of the method selected**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary logistic Regression assumes a linear relationship between exploratory variables and the log odds of the response variable, which is very uncommon in real-world scenarios. This includes health, where various factors such as a patient's specific medical history and correlated variables also affect the observation. A pre-requisite of using this method is moderate-low multicollinearity between independent variables, which is unlikely since many physiological variables are often correlated (ex. age and blood pressure). This interpretation may simplify our view of the dataset, although many real-world correlated input variables can influence the calculated magnitude of an individual independent variable's effect on the likelihood of heart disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Issues with using LASSO regression:\n",
    "- Biased estimators: the sampling distributions of LASSO estimators are not centered at the true value of the parameter.\n",
    "- \"double dipping\": The same data cannot be used to select variables of the model and also conduct inference, however this post-inference issue occurs when fitting an LS regression after LASSO\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What can be done to handle this**:\n",
    "- To handle highly-correlated variables: Lasso ridge will be used for selecting variables by finding the lowest MSE values, and dropping the variables that may be problematically highly correlated (high MSE values)\n",
    "- To handle biased estimators: post-lasso technique can be applied by fitting regular least squares onto all exploratory variables LASSO selects, although this does not apply to a logistic model with a binary non-continuous response variable, so other models may be explored to account for this weakness\n",
    "- To handle \"double dipping\": we split the data into two parts, where one is for model selection, the other for inference"

The variables _sex_, _cp_, _trestbps_, _exang_, _oldpeak_, _slope_, _ca_, and _thal_ have p-values < 0.05, where _sex_,_cp_,_exang_, and _ca_ have especially strongly statistically significant correlations to the likelihood of heart disease, suggesting these are the best predictor variables for creating a logistic model to determine the probability an individual has heart disease.\n",
