    "The topic we are looking at is focused around heart disease. Understanding heart disease and its causes is vital as it remains a leading cause of death globally, impacting millions of lives annually. Identifying key risk factors, such as lifestyle choices, genetic predispositions, and physiological markers, enables early intervention and the development of targeted prevention strategies, ultimately reducing mortality and improving quality of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is related to heart disease prediction and contains data collected from multiple sources (Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V). This dataset dates from 1988 and consists of heart disease data collected from multiple hospitals across different regions. It includes 14 variables commonly used in heart disease research, with 1025 observations. The primary goal of this dataset is to predict the presence of heart disease based on various medical attributes. The \"target\" variable indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.\n",

    "The data provides us with a plethora of observations that make answering this question easy. The dataset contains the relevant variables that can help analyze the relationship between age and cholesterol levels with the diagnosis of heart disease. Here's how each variable contributes:\n",
    "- `age` (age): Earlier studies suggest that the likelihood of developing heart disease increases with age making it a crucial variable for analysis. \n",
    "- `cholesterol` (chol): High cholesterol is a well-known risk factor for heart disease thus, analyzing its relationship with the diagnosis of heart disease will provide valuable information about its impact on heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Cholesterol levels often increase with age, thus increasing the likelihood of developing heart disease, so it may be important to include this interaction term.\n",

    "Utilizing these variables, we will be able to construct a statistical model to evaluate how they jointly influence the likelihood of having heart disease. Plots can be used to illustrate and visualize the relationship of these variables to heart disease. \n",

    "This question primarily focuses on inference but also has elements of prediction. This analysis aims to understand the relationship between the explanatory variables (age, cholesterol) and the response variable (likelihood of heart disease). Employing different statistical techniques from our studies, we will be able to infer how changes in age and cholesterol levels statistically affect heart health. To draw conclusions about the population from which the sample is drawn, we involve parameter estimations and hypothesis testing. While the main goal is to understand the relationships, the results of the analysis could also be used to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on their age and cholesterol levels. Thus, the model can provide a useful tool for predicting heart disease risk in future patients. "

    "Boxplots allow for the comparison of the central tendency (median) and spread (quantiles) of both variables for individuals with and without heart disease. The benefit of visualizing the variables separately with two separate boxplots for each heart disease status (target = 0 and target = 1) is that it allows for a clear comparison of the distribution of variables like age or cholesterol between the two groups. This visualization highlights key patterns, such as differences in medians, spread, and potential outliers, which could indicate a relationship between the variable and heart disease. It helps detect skewness, extreme values, and assess whether a particular variable contributes to the likelihood of heart disease. Overall, it provides valuable insights for understanding how heart disease status is related to specific health factors."

    "LASSO Regression to fit a Binary Logistic Regression for Inferential Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Why is this method appropriate?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Logistic Regression is an effective method for binary classification, particularly when determining the relationship between continuous numeric input variables and a binary dependent variable. In other words, this method of choice is appropriate for this analysis because the target variable (target) is binary, where a value of 1 indicates the presence of heart disease and 0 indicates its absence. This type of problem is a typical binary classification task, making logistic regression an ideal method for analysis. Logistic regression models the probability of an event occuring, which is well-suited for estimating the probability of each value in dichotomous dependent variables. Moreover, it allows for the inclusion of multiple explanatory variables which enables a more compelx and comprehensive analysis of factors contributing to heart disease. Additionally, logistic regression is widely used in medical research to model outcomes with binary responses, in our case: the presence or absence of heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's performance is enhanced by using LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), which helps reduce overfitting by applying shrinkage to the coefficients. LASSO performs feature selection, identifying input variables with minimal multicollinearity, and ensuring that only the most significant variables are included in the mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Required Assumptions to Apply Binary Logistic Regression: </b>\n",
    "1. The target variable is binary with two possible outcomes (in this dataset: 0 = no heart disease and 1=has heart disease)\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. The observations in the dataset are assumed to be independent of each other. No correlated data points exist, each observation was independently collected, and had no influence on each other. If there is any autocorrelation or clustering (e.g., if patients in the same family are included), this assumption could be violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other (i.e. no multicollinearity), as this could make the model unstable.Moderate or very low multicollinearity is ideal where explanatory variables should be weakly or not at all correlated to prevent issues with lower precision, such as estimated coefficients with large confidence intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Logistic regression assumes a sufficient sample size to estimate the model parameters accurately."

    "<b>Potential Limitations or Weaknesses of Binary Logistic Regression?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary logistic Regression assumes a linear relationship between exploratory variables and the log odds of the response variable, which is very uncommon in real-world scenarios. This includes health, where various factors such as a patient's specific medical history and correlated variables also affect the observation. A pre-requisite of using this method is moderate-low multicollinearity between independent variables, which is unlikely since many physiological variables are often correlated (ex. age and blood pressure). This interpretation may simplify our view of the dataset, although many real-world correlated input variables can influence the calculated magnitude of an individual independent variable's effect on the likelihood of heart disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the relationship between the predictors and the log-odds of heart disease is non-linear, logistic regression may not provide the most accurate results. In such cases, transformations or more complex models may be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multicollinearity between explanatory variables distorts the model and inflates standard errors, which can lead to misleading conclusions. If multicollinearity is present, variable selection or dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA may be required. It is important to check for multicollinearity and possibly remove highly correlated predictors or combine them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Logistic regression requires a sufficiently large sample size, especially when many predictors are included. Smaller sample sizes can lead to overfitting and unreliable estimates which is not good for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Logistic regression is sensitive to outliers which affects the model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The assumption that the relationship between the predictors and the log-odds of the outcome is linear may not always hold. when this assumption is violated, the model may not perform properly. In such cases, alternative models may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Potential Limitations or Weaknesses of LASSO Regression?</b>\n",
    "1. Biased estimators: the sampling distributions of LASSO estimators are not centered at the true value of the parameter.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. \"Double Dipping\": The same data cannot be used to select variables of the model and also conduct inference, however this post-inference issue occurs when fitting an LS regression after LASSO\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> What can be done to handle this: </b>\n",
    "1. To handle highly-correlated variables: Lasso ridge will be used for selecting variables by finding the lowest MSE values, and dropping the variables that may be problematically highly correlated (high MSE values)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To handle biased estimators: post-lasso technique can be applied by fitting regular least squares onto all exploratory variables LASSO selects, although this does not apply to a logistic model with a binary non-continuous response variable, so other models may be explored to account for this weakness\n",
